# blits-vscode

This is a VSCode extension for the Blits framework. It provides syntax highlighting, code completion, error checking, and other features to make working with Blits easier.

## Features

### Syntax Highlighting

Template definitions are highlighted as HTML. 

### Code Completion [WIP]

The extension offers context-aware IntelliSense for Blits framework, focusing specifically on component properties and names within template definitions. For code outside of these templates, the extension defers to VSCode's built-in IntelliSense.

The code completion feature is designed to avoid suggesting duplicate component properties, providing a cleaner and more efficient coding experience.
